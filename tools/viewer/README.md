# GitHub Copilot CLI Session Viewer (Streamlit)

A Python Streamlit-based tool for analyzing and exploring GitHub Copilot CLI session logs with an intuitive web interface.

## Features

- üìä **Interactive Dashboard**: View session statistics including total interactions, tokens, models used, and session duration
- üîç **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by model, search content, minimum token count
- üí¨ **Incremental Message View**: Show only new messages in each interaction for cleaner analysis
- üß© **Session Correlation (sessionId Grouping)**: Automatically groups multiple log files that share the same `sessionId` (derived from filename suffix or embedded field) so you can view parent + sub-agent activity as a unified timeline
- üîß **Tool Call Visualization**: Special formatting for tool calls and results
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- üöÄ **Auto-Discovery**: Automatically suggests recent session files

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Run Scripts
```bash
# Windows Command Prompt
run_viewer.bat

# Windows PowerShell
.\run_viewer.ps1
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run jsonl_viewer.py
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the application** using one of the methods above
2. **Load a session file**:
   - Upload a JSONL file using the sidebar file uploader, OR
   - Use the auto-suggested default file if available
3. **Explore your data**:
   - View session statistics in the metrics row
   - Use filters to narrow down interactions
   - Expand individual interactions to see details
   - Toggle incremental message view for cleaner analysis
   - (Directory Mode) Enable "Group by sessionId" to merge per-agent OpenAI logs that belong to the same CLI session

## Session File Locations

The tool automatically looks for session files in standard locations:
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\[username]\.ghccli\tmp\sessions\`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.ghccli/tmp/sessions/`

### Session Correlation Logic

Many CLI runs that invoke sub-agents create multiple OpenAI JSONL log files that nonetheless share a common logical `sessionId`.

This viewer detects and groups those files using the following heuristics:
1. If a log entry contains a `sessionId` field, that value is authoritative.
2. Otherwise, it parses the filename pattern: `yyyy_MM_dd_hh_mm_ss_<sessionId>.jsonl` and uses the trailing segment as the `sessionId`.
3. All files with the same resolved `sessionId` are shown under a single group in the sidebar (when grouping is enabled).
4. Within a group, files are ordered lexicographically (timestamp prefix) and their entries are merged and chronologically sorted by individual entry timestamps.

This provides a lightweight, non-invasive way to correlate parent agent activity with sub-agent executions without modifying existing log generation.

## Features Comparison with HTML Version

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit 1.28.0+
- Pandas 1.5.0+

## File Structure

```
tools/eval/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jsonl_viewer.py      # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jsonl_viewer.html    # Original HTML version (preserved)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_viewer.bat       # Windows batch launcher
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_viewer.ps1       # PowerShell launcher
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## Development

The Streamlit version offers several advantages over the HTML version:

1. **Better Data Handling**: Uses pandas for efficient data processing
2. **Interactive Widgets**: Real-time filtering and searching
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features and visualizations
4. **Python Ecosystem**: Can leverage any Python library for analysis
5. **State Management**: Better handling of user interactions and data state

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
If you get a port conflict, Streamlit will automatically suggest an alternative port.

### File Not Found
Ensure your JSONL files are in the expected locations or use the file uploader.

### Performance Issues
For very large session files (>10MB), consider using the filtering options to reduce the data displayed.
