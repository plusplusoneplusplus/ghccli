This repository contains GHCCLI, an enhanced command-line AI workflow tool that connects to your
tools, understands your code and accelerates your workflows. GHCCLI is built on top of the Gemini CLI
with additional customizations and features.

With GHCCLI you can:

- Query and edit large codebases.
- Generate new apps from PDFs or sketches, using multimodal AI capabilities.
- Automate operational tasks, like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases.
- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including media generation tools
- Ground your queries with integrated search capabilities.
- Access multiple AI providers including Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI.

## üìã Key Features

### Code Understanding & Generation

- Query and edit large codebases
- Generate new apps from PDFs, images, or sketches using multimodal capabilities
- Debug issues and troubleshoot with natural language

### Automation & Integration

- Automate operational tasks like querying pull requests or handling complex rebases
- Use MCP servers to connect new capabilities, including [media generation with Imagen, Veo or Lyria](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/vertex-ai-creative-studio/tree/main/experiments/mcp-genmedia)
- Run non-interactively in scripts for workflow automation

### Advanced Capabilities

- Conversation checkpointing to save and resume complex sessions
- Custom context files (GEMINI.md) to tailor behavior for your projects

### GitHub Integration

Integrate Gemini CLI directly into your GitHub workflows with [**Gemini CLI GitHub Action**](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli):

- **Pull Request Reviews**: Automated code review with contextual feedback and suggestions
- **Issue Triage**: Automated labeling and prioritization of GitHub issues based on content analysis
- **On-demand Assistance**: Mention `@gemini-cli` in issues and pull requests for help with debugging, explanations, or task delegation
- **Custom Workflows**: Build automated, scheduled and on-demand workflows tailored to your team's needs

## üîê Authentication Options

Choose the authentication method that best fits your needs:

### Option 1: OAuth login (Using your Google Account)

**‚ú® Best for:** Individual developers as well as anyone who has a Gemini Code Assist License. (see [quota limits and terms of service](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/quotas) for details)

**Benefits:**

- **Free tier**: 60 requests/min and 1,000 requests/day
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro** with 1M token context window
- **No API key management** - just sign in with your Google account
- **Automatic updates** to latest models

#### Start Gemini CLI, then choose OAuth and follow the browser authentication flow when prompted

   ```bash
   ghccli
   ```

#### With NPX (upstream Gemini CLI)

For the original Gemini CLI functionality:

   ```bash
   npx https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
   ```

### Common Configuration steps

3. **Pick a color theme**
4. **Authenticate:** When prompted, choose your preferred AI provider and sign in. GHCCLI supports multiple authentication methods including Google accounts, GitHub Copilot, and OpenAI.

You are now ready to use GHCCLI!

### Use a Gemini API key:

The Gemini API provides a free tier with [100 requests per day](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits#free-tier) using Gemini 2.5 Pro, control over which model you use, and access to higher rate limits (with a paid plan):

1. Generate a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).
2. Set it as an environment variable in your terminal. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your generated key.

```bash
# Get your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
gemini
```
```bash
# Get your key from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
gemini
```

2. **Authentication:** The CLI will guide you through GitHub's OAuth flow:

   - Just select "GitHub Copilot" in the authentication menu
   - The CLI will display a device code and verification URL
   - Visit the URL and enter the code to authorize

### Use OpenAI directly:

Connect directly to OpenAI's API or OpenAI-compatible APIs:

1. **Prerequisites:** You need an OpenAI API key from your [OpenAI account](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2. **Configuration:** Set the required environment variables:

   ```bash
   # Required: Your OpenAI API key
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-openai-api-key"
   
   # Optional: Custom base URL (defaults to OpenAI)
   export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://api.openai.com/v1"
   
   # Optional: Default model (defaults to gpt-4o)
   export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4"
   ```

For other authentication methods, including Google Workspace accounts, see the [authentication](./docs/cli/authentication.md) guide.

## Examples

Once the CLI is running, you can start interacting with AI from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
ghccli
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/plusplusoneplusplus/ghccli
cd ghccli
ghccli
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
